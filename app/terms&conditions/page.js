        You accept this Agreement and agree to be bound by its terms by either

      <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6">2. Agreement Amendment</h3>
      <p className="mt-2">
        The Program will change over time, and the terms of this Agreement will
        need to change accordingly. We reserve the right to change the terms of
        this Agreement and will notify you via the registered email in your
        Program account.
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6">3. Term and Termination</h3>
      <p className="mt-2">
        The term of this Agreement will begin upon your acceptance and will
        continue until terminated by either party. We reserve the right to
        terminate or suspend your account if we have concerns about your account
        activity or if you breach applicable laws or this Agreement. We will
        notify you upon termination and provide instructions on how to appeal if
        you believe the termination was in error.
      </p>
      <p className="mt-2">
        You may terminate this Agreement at any time by providing notice, and we
        will cease selling your Digital Books and on-demand Print Books within 5
        business days. We may continue to sell any remaining inventory of your
        Print Books and fulfill pending customer orders.
